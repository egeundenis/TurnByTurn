<br><br>-----------------------------------BRAWLER CHANGES-------------------------------------<br>
				
<br>Crow: (ADJUSTMENT)
<br>With the recent regeneration changes, It's no shocker that Crow will be quite powerful. So a good nerf before he gets out of control is very much needed.
<br><br>Attack: (10 + -3 REGEN) -> (15 + -2 REGEN)
<br>Regeneration: 5 -> 3
<br>Super: No longer charges itself
<br>Passive: %25 -> %33 | No longer decrease if the enemy has positive regeneration
<br>Name: Crow -> Raven
				
<br><br>Missy: (NERF)
<br>Yet another brawler that will be changed in the regeneration update, but for the better this time! She even will have a hypercharged super! Before missy dominates the meta, we will nerf her a "little" bit.
<br><br>Super: +15 -> +10
<br>Second Gadget: -x3 -> -x2

<br><br>Zach: (NERF)
<br>His Sticky Investment gadget will be OP! He was already quite strong, and he gets his hypercharge so fast! So we're nerfing him a notch
<br><br>First Gadget: (-%15 HP, +%2 REGEN) ->  (-%15 HP, +%1.5 REGEN)
<br>Attack: %11 -> %10.5
<br>Passive: %6.6 -> %5
				
<br><br>Giran: (NERF)
<br>His previous buff was too much for him! He's shredding through everyone... But We loved that he uses his super often like he should be. So nerfing his Super Damage would be a better way to nerf him as He's getting a hypercharged super aswell.
<br><br>Super Damage: 50 -> 40

<br><br>Gusty: (NERF)
<br>He has been strong for a while now. This nerf will make him harder to stack up his shields and harrassing low damage brawlers without making him completely useless. Besides, he has a hypercharged super now!
<br><br>Attack Damage: 35 -> 30

<br><br>Kasse: (NERF)
<br>Kasse will get his hypercharge way easier than other brawlers, and he's been very strong lately! This nerf should handle him good.
<br><br>Attack Damage: 6 -> 5

<br><br>Anvaa: (BUFF)
<br>Since negative regeneration is not effected by shields now, Her passive feels awkward as she dies instantly from the stun status decreasing her regeneration anyway. This is mostly a bugfix.
<br><br>Passive: (1 HP + 100 Shield) -> (30 HP  + 100 Shield) 

<br><br>Amber: (ADJUSTMENT)
<br>Amber basically always wants to use her stunning super and the soulstealer attacks feels awkward to use against low HP brawlers. This changes should help her be more well rounded:
<br><br>Attacks:
<br>Rapidfire: 20 x (%50 -> %33 -> %25 ... ) -> 20 x (%75 -> %50 -> %33 -> ...)
<br>Harsh Pierce: 40 + (40 if below %30) -> 40 + (40 if below %50)
<br>Soulfire: %10 -> (15 + %7.5)
<br>Supers:
<br>Fiercefire: 30 x (%90 -> %75 -> %50 ...) -> 25 x (%95 -> %85 -> %75 ...)
<br>Soulless Strike: %15 -> (20 + %12.5)

<br><br>Light: (NERF)
<br>Light is too strong, annoying and anxiety inducing! This nerf should balance him.
<br><br>Super: 25 turns -> 30 turns 

<br><br>Clyde: (NERF)
<br>With the buff to Strengthened status she will shred through everyone! This nerf should keep her in check
<br>Passive: STRENGTHENED -> ENRAGED

<br><br>Lisa: (BUFF)
<br>If Lisa loses regeneration she will die immediatly when she uses her super! This is especially true for regen decreasers and stunners, this should help her a little
<br>Regeneration 2 -> 5

<br><br>John: (NERF)
<br>John feels impossible to balance. He deals too much damage but if he gets low too fast he is nothing! Before his inevitible rework, this should bring him down.
<br><br>Attack: 65 -> 60
<br>Super: (60 + %75 HP) -> (50 + %65 HP)
<br>HP: 350 -> 325
