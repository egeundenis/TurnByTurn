<br><br>-----------------------------------BRAWLER CHANGES-------------------------------------<br>
							
<br>Louis: (ADJUSTMENT)
<br>Louis' super doesn't feel like a threat anymore, with this change it should feel much more threatening
<br><br>Super: 6 Turns -> 10 Turns | No longer can charge super, it's added to the energy field instead.

<br><br><br>Amber: (NERF)
<br>She feels oddly tanky because of her passive, this should balance her.
<br><br>Passive: 10 -> 5
<br>HP: 550 -> 500

<br><br><br>Todd: (REWORK)
<br>Todd's super is super weird. It doesn't really make sense? He's a tank, he shouldn't deal damage and heal at the same time! We had to make him feel like a tank artificially with his passive and gadgets! This rework should make him feel much more like a tanker now.
<br><br>Super: Todd takes and deals %50 less damage for 5 turns and then stuns the enemy at the end.
<br>Attack: 30 -> 20
<br>First Gadget: 5 -> 3
<br>Second Gadget: STRENGHTENED -> ENRAGED
<br>Regeneration: 5 -> 3
<br>Passive: 150 -> 100
<br>HP: 800 -> 700

<br><br><br>Betty: (REWORK)
<br>Betty was always a pain in the ass to code, and I've had enough to make her work. This rework to her super will keep her interesting without making me insecure about my coding skills!
<br><br>Super: Creates a clone that uses enemy's own super against them! With each use, Betty summons one more clone!

<br><br><br>Ignace: (NERF)
<br>Ignace was consistently overpowered since the regeneration and weakness changes, this should bring him down.
<br><br>HP: 550 -> 500
<br>Attack: 30 -> 25
<br>Super: 80 -> 60

<br><br><br>Qirale: (ADJUSTMENT)
<br>Qirale is annoying to deal and play with. WEAKENED effect is annoying, Earth Super makes her impossible to kill and Fire Super was underwhelming, yet spammed. These changes should make her feel better.
<br><br>Specific: No longer randomly changes, they're in a cycle of WATER -> FIRE -> EARTH -> AIR now. It also now has 10 uses
<br>Water Normal: (25 damage + WEAKENED) -> (25 Damage + 10 Heal)
<br>Water Super: (40 damage + 100 Heal) -> (50 Damage + 50 Heal)
<br>Fire Super: (70 Damage + 2 Regen Decrease) -> (50 Damage + 5 Regen Decrease)
<br>Earth Super: (50 Damage + 125 Shield) -> (50 Damage + 100 Shield)
<br>Air Super: (30 Damage + CONFUSED) -> (50 Damage + CONFUSED)

<br><br><br>Itan: (BUFF)
<br>Itan is weak. He just dies before he can do anything and if he can get a super, Beurc just dies with him too. This changes should make him feel better.
<br><br>Attack: 10 -> 15
<br>Super: Instead of fully tanking all the damage, they split it %50.
