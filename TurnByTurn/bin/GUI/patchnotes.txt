---NEW FEATURES---<br/>

<br>Super Charging is now completely independent from the damage dealt! It will be determined by percentages! This had to be done a long time ago, but we postponed it a lot because we were balancing the normal attacks
 thinking how it will effect the charge rate, this way it will no longer hinder the balancing anymore! Especially for Status effects, Timmy and Zach! From this point on, normal attacks should feel more balanced over time! Check HELP for all the info you need!

<br><br>New Mechanic: TRAITS! For now we have: Magical: Can not get soft negative status effects, Tank: Gets super charge from getting attacked!

<br><br>New Spell: Laser Rain!

<br><br>New Reworks: Kasse and Anton!

<br><br>New Hypercharged supers: Kasse, Aboa, June

<br><br>New Fighters: June the Time Traveler and Aboa the Fairy Swordsman!

<br><br>New Status: Poisoned! The poisoned fighters will heal only %50 efficiently!
